# Δoxa Binarization Framework
## Introduction
ΔBF, is an image binarization framework written in C++ which focuses exclusively on local adaptive thresholding algorithms.
In English, this means that it has the ability to turn a color or gray scale image into a black and white image.

## Overview
The goal of this library is to provide the building blocks one might use to advance the state of handwritten manuscript binarization.
What sets this binarization library apart is that it is intended to be used by those interested in experimenting with their own algorithms and enhancements.
Instead of being relegated to MATLAB, or obfuscated by mathematics in a research paper, a lot of effort has gone into exposing these binarization techniques in an open and transparent way.
A key objective in designing this framework was to make it modular and as easy to use as possible, without sacrificing speed and without depending heavily on 3rd party frameworks.
This library is also heavily unit tested to help ensure quality, and to quickly spot problems after experimenting with the codebase.


### Performance Analysis

These numbers were generated by running the Kumite/DimMak test in the Unit Test suite against a set of images that come with the repository.

| Algorithm | K     | Window | Accuracy | F-Measure | PSNR  |
| --------- |:-----:|:------:|:--------:|:---------:|:-----:|
| Niblack   | -0.65 | 124    | 96.59    | 90.20     | 14.67 |
| Sauvola   | 0.11  | 26     | 97.67    | 93.23     | 16.33 |
| Wolf      | 0.19  | 20     | 97.67    | 93.29     | 16.33 |
| NICK      | -0.11 | 42     | 97.63    | 93.05     | 16.26 |

It should be noted that the Ground Truth used to generate these numbers is, like virtually all Ground Truths, subjective and a work in progress.
A PhotoShop PSD file is attached that can be used to make corrections to the Ground Truth as needed.

### Goals
* Refactor to incorporate tiling in order to reduce memory utilization
* Provide the Distance Reciprocal Distortion  (DRD) metric
* Improve and expand the PPM image format support
* Internally process 8 bit images to reduce memory consumption
